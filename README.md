The purpose of this module is to provide `parse` and
`serialize` methods that enable round tripping of data
from [iCalendar](https://icalendar.org/) format to
JSON serializable objects.

For the most part, parsing is handled by
[ical.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ical.js) and
serialization by
[ical-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ical-generator).
